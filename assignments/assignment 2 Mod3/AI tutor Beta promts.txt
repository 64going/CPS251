whats the problum? Argument type mismatch: actual type is 'Unit', but 'BorderStroke' was expected.
Function invocation 'width(...)' expected.
AI:
It seems like there might be an issue with the usage of the width function. The error message "Argument type mismatch: actual type is 'Unit', but 'BorderStroke' was expected" indicates that the function is receiving a Unit type instead of the expected BorderStroke type.

To resolve this issue, you need to ensure that the width function is being used correctly with the appropriate parameters.

If you can provide the specific code snippet where this error is occurring, I can help you identify and correct the problem.

You:
.border(if(isSelected) {this.width = 3.dp, this.color = MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary})
AI:
The error in your code is due to the incorrect usage of the .border function. The .border function expects a BorderStroke object as a parameter, but you are passing a lambda expression inside the if statement.

To fix this issue, you can create a BorderStroke object outside of the .border function and then conditionally apply it based on the isSelected flag. Here's how you can correct the code:

.border(
    if (isSelected) {
        BorderStroke(3.dp, MaterialTheme.colorScheme.primary)
    } else {
        BorderStroke(0.dp, Color.Transparent) // No border when not selected
    }
)
This code creates a BorderStroke object with the specified width and color when isSelected is true. When isSelected is false, it sets the border width to 0 and uses a transparent color to remove the border.

By providing a BorderStroke object directly to the .border function, you ensure that the correct type is passed as expected.
